A: Minimize data collection, secure storage, restrict access, and plan deletions.

Q: How can I test rollback plans?
A: Run simulated rollbacks in staging, document steps, and ensure data compatibility.

Q: How do I approach multi-region resilience?
A: Design for stateless services, replicate data appropriately, and test failover.

Q: How can I monitor user journeys end-to-end?
A: Use synthetic tests, trace IDs across services, and dashboard key funnels.

Q: How do I avoid over-logging?
A: Log key events and errors with context, avoid PII, and set retention policies.

Q: How can I make CLI tools user-friendly?
A: Provide help text, sensible defaults, clear errors, and examples.

Q: How do I design good pagination?
A: Use cursors where possible, limit defaults, and include total/next links if needed.

Q: How can I minimize downtime in deploys?
A: Use rolling/canary deploys, health checks, and pre-warmed instances.

Q: How do I ensure schema changes are safe?
A: Add new columns first, backfill, switch reads, then remove old columns last.

Q: How can I track service ownership?
A: Keep an owner/contact per service, and list it in code/docs and monitoring.

Q: How do I keep runbooks discoverable?
A: Link them from alerts and dashboards, and store in a central accessible repo.

Q: How can I design for graceful degradation?
A: Identify critical vs. optional features, add fallbacks, and handle partial failures cleanly.

Q: How do I improve front-end performance?
A: Optimize images, lazy load, reduce JS, and measure with core web vitals.

Q: How can I plan incident drills?
A: Choose scenarios, timebox, practice comms/runbooks, and debrief for improvements.

Q: How do I keep environments secure?
A: Patch regularly, restrict access, enforce MFA, and segment networks.

Q: How can I handle secrets in CI?
A: Use secure secret stores, avoid printing in logs, and restrict permissions.

Q: How do I build resilience into queues?
A: Handle poison messages, set DLQs, monitor queue depth, and use idempotent consumers.

Q: How can I improve API discoverability?
A: Provide docs, examples, SDKs, and clear versioning; list in a catalog.

Q: How do I keep infra diagrams updated?
A: Generate from code/tools where possible, and review diagrams quarterly.

Q: How can I ensure consistent error responses?
A: Define an error format, include codes/messages, and document them.

Q: How do I manage schema versioning?
A: Use migrations with versions, backward compatibility, and clear deprecation steps.

Q: How can I improve security for third-party libs?
A: Pin versions, audit regularly, and replace unsupported or risky dependencies.

Q: How do I test cross-service flows?
A: Use integration environments, contract tests, and synthetic checks on key journeys.

Q: How can I prioritize observability work?
A: Start with critical paths, error/latency metrics, and high-severity incident areas.

Q: How do I manage config drift?
A: Use declarative config, detect drift with tooling, and reconcile automatically.
