# Math position training data generation
GENERATE_FOR: math
DATA:
PROBLEM: What is 15% of 80?
SOLUTION:
Step 1: Convert 15% to decimal: 15/100 = 0.15
Step 2: Multiply: 0.15 × 80 = 12
Answer: 12

PROBLEM: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15
SOLUTION:
Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 10
Step 2: Divide both sides by 2: x = 5
Answer: x = 5

GENERATE_FOR: math
DATA:
PROBLEM: What is the area of a circle with radius 5?
SOLUTION:
Step 1: Use formula A = πr²
